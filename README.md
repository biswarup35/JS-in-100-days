Javascript is one of the easiest programming languages to learn but, people find it either hard or weird, Why?

JavaScript is so flexible - It is a multi paradigm, prototype based object oriented programming language. It supports object oriented, imperative and functional programming styles. This is where people find it hard because developers can leverage many programming styles. The same thing can be done in many ways in JavaScript. For lerners it may lead to confusion.

Therefore, we the JavaScript developers should help the newbies by explaining the core concepts. This OpenSource blog is dedicated to the JavaScript community. How yo can help?
